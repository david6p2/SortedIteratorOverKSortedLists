import UIKit

//: Given K sorted lists of up to N elements in each list, return a sorted iterator over all the items.
//:
//: Importent notes:
//: * K denotes the number of lists.
//: * N denotes the length of the longest list.
//: * You may assume K << N
//: * There aren't necessarily N items in each list, but there could be.
//: * Items are not unique, if an item appears X times (in a single list or in several lists), we would expect the iterator to return the item X consecutive times.
//:
//: Receiving the following lists:
//:
//: 1: [1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
//:
//: 2: [3, 4, 4, 6]
//:
//: 3: [0, 2, 8]
//:
//: Would yield the following result:
//:
//: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9]

//: [Next](@next)
